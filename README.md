This is the *Coffee Machine Simulator with Java* project I made myself.


<div>
<p>What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.<br>
In this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.<br>
This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.</p>
